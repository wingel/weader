kxml2
=====

kXML is used to provide a XmlPullParser implementation on Android.  To
be able to test code using the XmlPullPaser APIs without having to run
Android I have checked in kXML2 libraries in git.

Information from the web page:

kXML 2 implements the XmlPull API. Please find general information
about XmlPull parsers including the interface documentation at
xmlpull.org.
